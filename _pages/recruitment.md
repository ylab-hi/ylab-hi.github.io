# Open positions

Thank you for your interest in joining the Yang Lab.

## Graduate students

Dr. Yang is a graduate faculty member of the [Driskill Graduate Program in Life Sciences](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/sites/dgp/index.html). If you are a current PhD student of DGP seeking a graduate research assistant (GRA) position in the Yang Lab, please contact [Dr. Yang directly](/contact). We are primarily a computational lab working on cancer genomics, so a background in coding and/or genetics helps students make the most of their work.

**Multiple GRA positions are currently available in the lab.**

## Postdoctoral researchers

We are looking for a highly motivated candidate specializing in Bioinformatics to join the Yang lab. The goal of this position is to lead multiple research projects, develop novel computational algorithm(s), perform data analysis, collaborate with biologists and physicians, and present/publish the results in scientific conferences/journals. The main focus is to explore the functional consequences of genomic and transcriptomic alterations in cancer samples, to identify cancer driver events, and to understand the underlying mechanisms of cancer progression and drug resistance by integrating multi-dimensional data from large-scale cancer studies such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our work have been published (or in press) in high impact journal such as Nature, Nature Genetics, Nature Immunology, Molecular Cell,  Nature Communications, Genome Medicine, Clinical Cancer Research, Cancer Research, and Bioinformatics. The lab offers a collaborative and supportive environment and has a strong track record in helping trainees obtain their own postdoctoral fellowship to build independent research careers. The lab has expertise in high-performance computing and analytical pipelines, allowing novel analytic methods to be performed at scale. We are currently looking for researchers with a strong computational background in:

- A Ph.D. in Bioinformatics/Computational Biology/Computer Science/Statistics/Physics/Biology or a related field
- Experience in Linux
- Proficiency in at least one programming languages (e.g. Python, R, Perl, Java, C/C++, Matlab)
- Experiences with high-throughput sequencing data (WGS, WES, RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq) analysis

If you are interested, please contact [Dr. Yang directly](/contact).
