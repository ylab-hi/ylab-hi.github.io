### Overview
Although I started my career as a sheer computer scientist, I quickly developed a strong interest for biological problems and have steered my studies forward bioinformatics. Now, I have dedicated my research on biological systems where I can benefit from my engineering background. Similarly to bioinformatics that follows an interdisciplinary approach, I like to combine concept from different fields to keep abreast with science and technology.
### Education
- Ph.D., Bioinformatics, University of Stuttgart
- B.S., Computer Science, University of Bonn
