### Overview
I'm interested in cancer genomics, and in particular understanding the underlying mechanisms of cancer through genomic and transcriptomic alterations and multi-omic data analysis. 

Before joining the BICB program I completed an advanced graduate degree in philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh, where my main area of research was logic and epistemology.
