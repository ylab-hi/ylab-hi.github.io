### Overview
I keep combining bioinformatic strategies with large-scale datasets to study genome issues. My past project integrated GWAS, trait-expression and eQTL analyses, and uncovered genetic variants that have been missed by previous stringent GWAS accounting for population structure and kinship. In addition, I investigated the genetic and evolutionary characteristics of lncRNAs and prioritized the functional lncRNAs through an approach integrating eQTL mapping and population genomic analysis. These works have been published in the Plant Journal and Theoretical and Applied Genetics, respectively.
