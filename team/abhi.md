### Overview
As an individual who has always been riveted by nature and its complexities, I am naturally drawn towards the study of biochemistry and medicine. My formal training through an integrative program of biology and society as an undergraduate strongly informs the lens through which I view human health issuesâ€”interdisciplinary and multifaced. Post-graduation, three years of training as a research technician in the neurodegenerative disease field have shaped my interests and skills in translational biomedical research and computational genomics. 
### Education
- B.S., Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University
