### Overview
In the last 8+ years, I’ve been spending my time working on a number of projects, most of them with the central theme of exploring, analyzing and visualizing biological data in a context of complicated biology.

This means that I’ve been revisiting the core concepts behind methods for association-relationship between biological data and biological stories. using different approaches from a broad range of disciplines (e.g. statistics, epidemiology and bioinformatics).

In particular, I’ve done a lot of programming and reading for genetics, genomics and data analysis.
Behind all the stuff that I’ve done there is a single idea and goal: to make all the biological data talk the beauty of life.
