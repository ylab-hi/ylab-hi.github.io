### Overview
In the last 8+ years, I’ve been working on a number of projects, most of them with the central theme of exploring, analyzing, and visualizing biological data in the context of complicated biology.

This means that I’ve been revisiting the core concepts behind methods for association-relationship between biological data and biological stories. using different approaches from a broad range of disciplines (e.g. statistics, epidemiology, and bioinformatics).

In particular, I’ve done a lot of programming and reading for genetics, genomics and data analysis.
Behind all the stuff that I’ve done, there is a single idea and goal: to make all the biological data talk about the beauty of life.

### Education
